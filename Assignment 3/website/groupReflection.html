		<p>The group atmosphere has improved since assignment two. Things are running more smoothly as everyone is aware of their expectations and how the group operates. </p>
		<p>I think the group can improve to be more effective by meeting more often. This will allow the group to bond more effectively and work in more unison manner. </p>
		<p>The thing that was very surprising for me was then the results came out for Assignment 2, the group read the feedback and was very accepting of the results. There was no blame or questions asking about the assignment but rather a lot of self-reflection. Self -reflection areas in which could of done better and how to future proof the assignment to gain more points. </p>

		<p>The team has worked together really well and communicated with each other better from the previous assignment in my belief. We all managed to get our parts done and emailed the group with our parts a lot sooner and which allowed everyone to know where we are up to. This led to the team being able to focus on editing the documents sooner. Throughout the duration of this assignment. We all learnt from our mistakes and grew upon from that and stayed positive. We all volunteered to do certain parts of the assignment that we all felt comfortable with and asked each other questions about each other’s parts to grasp a better understanding of what was happening. This was caused due to the group being relaxed and comfortable with each other.</p>
		<p>I believe that we have improved all aspects from what we needed to work on as a group and as individuals. We all have improved pretty quickly which allowed us to produce a better dynamic in the team and a better group project that we have produced</p>

		<p>For our second assignment together, I feel as though overall our team worked very well together with each person carrying an equal as possible workload. Our overall communication picked up, with people getting better as conveying ideas around the group and putting up their hand when they need help. Often other team members would gladly step in to help wherever possible. We also have taken a much more measured approach this time around, ensuring that we are finishing far ahead of schedule for hand in and sending in drafts to our lecturers for their review. The only thing I feel could be improved would be a possible third mid-week meeting where we can catch up on our progress so there isn’t such a large gap of time between our existing Monday, Saturday catch ups. One thing that was surprising was the fact that we are so ahead of schedule and have worked so well together despite living in different states across AUS. This caused me to learn that within a group, if there exists good communication and solid work ethic from all parties, great things can be achieved. As a team overall, I feel that this assignment took what already worked for us in assignment one and made it even better!</p>

	<li>14.6 Jordan Uhe Reflection
		<p>This is the second assignment this group has done together, and because of this we have done a few things differently, firstly we appointed Don as the leader and meeting coordinator, this was because we had trouble with scheduling last time.  We also divided up all the work at the start and marked down who was to do what, this was so that we did not have a rush at the end if more work happens to be assigned to someone because of a problem.  In this project I was given a writing part, video editing part, and website launching part. The last 2 parts were dependent on other group members, and that caused me to be hurrying to finish this assignment in the last 5 days of the assessment period, this is not good practice, this increases everyone’s stress levels and lowers the final quality of the work. Though saying this, it is not the fault of the people which my parts are dependent on, because they must also wait till the whole group finished the written parts before they could do their own.  What I think would have fixed this is if the work is divided not just on length and difficulty, but also when all the parts needed for that section will be done and how long the person will have to complete it.</p>
