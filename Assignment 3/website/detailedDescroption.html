 <li><strong>4 Detailed Description</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>4.1 Aims
		<ul>
		<li>The specific aim for the project is to.” Unite people with updated information”. This aim will allow people to have the most updated information on their chosen websites and have people be able to be informed wherever they may be. The aim of uniting people with the most updated information will get people to know what is happening around the world or what is happening in a certain hobby or whatever the case maybe, in which people can get more knowledge of it a lot easier.
		<li>The first goal is “Find the trends”. By finding the trends of something. For example, shoes. If we are able to find what is trending and what people are talking about in the shoe industry. Then we are able to access what is happening and be able to created the technology that will help benefit for the shoe industry and find the best solution possible for all the people who want to either buy or read information about a certain shoe. This goal is expected to be one of the main priorities of creating this chrome extension. This will give us information on how we are able to create the extension and be able to use the known information and use it for different industries and people are interested in.
		<li>The second goal is “Create the extension”. This goal will lead us into creating the extension. It will allow us to actually start on creating the chrome extension and be able to experiment with different areas of the chrome extension. For example, creating a user-friendly UI and how the code works for the chrome extension.
		<li>The third goal is “Link the user and extension”. This just simply means to be able to create a link between the user and the website. In which it could be through email, text message or a web-alert. This will then create a link from the user and the desired website that they have chosen to get this notification and inform them where the change has happened. By creating this link between the user and the chrome extension, it will then get the user to use the extension for other websites and be able to get even more information that they would like to get.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>4.2 What are the most important parts of the project?
		<ul>
		<li>The most important part of the project is to be able to be able to create a link between the user and their chosen websites. This is really important because of the fact that the user needs to get notified that a change in a website has in fact occurred. With no form of being able to link the user and the website then the user will not be able to know when something has changed. This will then make the chrome extension obsolete and pointless.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>4.3 Which parts should have priority over the others
		<ul>
		<li>Creating the extension is the top priority of the project is creating the chrome extension. The team should dedicate most of their time to the creation of the extension itself. This is because that without creating a good quality chrome extension then people will not use it and will use other chrome extensions. By having the chrome extension completed and ready-to-use, consumers will then come to our project and use it because of the fact that it is completed and has been the team’s main priority
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<br />
<li><strong>5 Plans & Progress</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>5.1 How the project begain
		<ul>
		<li>The project began as a university assignment where 6 individuals were tasked with creating or developing an IT project. The group decided on the plan to develop a Chrome Application In which it allows users to track websites of any changes and if there are changes, alerts the users via email, text message or SMS.
		<li>The idea seems achievable at that time and was one of the major underlining factors in selecting this for the assignment theme. As we progressed through there was many constraints from knowledge, skills, teamwork, time and to financial commitments. As we submitted our assignment 2 for this unit, the idea was more achievable once we had done some research. As a result, the continuation of the developing application to become an active live application in which users can subscribe or purchase.
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.2 What your project will do?
		<ul>
		<li>The project aims to target a certain niche in the market. Groups such as bargain hunters and collectors where they need to continuously search for deals or items that are in high demand. This will help these collectors or hunters to be notified when these items are available or have changed status.   We aim to develop this project into a working solution to meet market demands from a user’s perspective. There are many options out there, but they are predominately checking if the website is live or not by performing routine pings to the website address.   
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.3 How will you do it?
		<ul>
		<li>The project is in its development stage right now. The group aims to have at least the development, staffing, backbone, features, UI (rough ins) available for investor considerations. Once all components are carefully considered and identified all the “what’s” and “how’s” we will need to go out and seek potential investors to assist us in funding the project. The project requires funding as there is certain skill sets, we do not possess in the group. We require funding to build the physical backbone of the application as well. Things such as servers, licencing, computer to host etc… 
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.4 How has it progressed
		<ul>
		<li>5.4.1 Development
			<ul>
			<li>Overall, the development of the project has progressed smoothly. As all projects there were bumps and dead ends at the start but the overall result has been achieving results. Development is always the hardest part in creating a project; there are so many ideas and different avenues in which the project can develop. Luckly, the decision in the group was unified in the very early stages and the end goal was clearly defined. Currently the group has been able to design the basic concept of the backbone infrastructure. Using Linux as the core, the CTO with his years of experience and knowledge will be the lead for this development and implementation. 
			<li>The UI will be managed by our development manager Stefan who will decide on the development team and how the team should be housed. Whether the project will be completed with UI developers in house or be up for tendering by external contractors. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.2 Staffing
			<ul>
			<li>Staffing levels are currently very limited, as it consists of the members currently involved in the initial project. 
				<ul>
				<li>Don Vu as the CEO
				<li>James Parker as the CMO
				<li>Johnathan Hazel as the CTO
				<li>James Eland and Jordan Uhe as the developer
				</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The backbone of the project is designed to operate on Linux platform with a SQL database. Hardware requirement are minimal, so the requirement for powerful hardware is not required. The application can operate and be hosted on a medium specification computer built as a server. More detailed information regarding this setup can be found in the Tools section.
			<li>The idea is that the group will develop and plan as much as practical and the remainder of the work will either be outsourced to tender or addition resources will be hired to complete the tasks.
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.3 Backbone
			<ul>
			<li>The backbone of the project is designed to operate on Linux platform with a SQL database. Hardware requirement are minimal, so the requirement for powerful hardware is not required. The application can operate and be hosted on a medium specification computer built as a server. More detailed information regarding this setup can be found in the Tools section.
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.4 Features
			<ul>
			<li>Features of the application will be allowing users to take a snapshot of the webpage they wish to monitor. The application will notify the user when the website has an update, whether it be price, quantity or availability
			<li>The user can subscribe to more premium services to monitor more webpages and specifics of the webpage. This premium subscription can be broken up into Tier one, Tier two, Tier three and Tier four, and the duration of the subscription can be from One month, Three month, Six months, One year.
			<li>The monetary tag has yet to be determine and will be evaluated on the amount of features the application can present to the user. Once we are able to determine this, most likely in the UAT phase; we will then determine the pricing for each Tier/Month. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.5 UI
			<ul>
			<li>The UI is the most important part of the developing stage, it needs to be simple, user friendly and efficient for the user. 
			<li>The UI is going to be straight forward and effective as to what each feature does. It needs to provide easy access to self helps or the support team for assistance. 
			<li>The specifics of the UI are still being developed and the group hopes to have it done before the presentation to potential stakeholders. This way the stakeholders can have a visual knowledge of what to expect in from this project. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />
		<li>5.4.6 Dead Ends
			<ul>
			<li>The restrictions we currently face is of two things, the ability to access the service/hardware and financial support. We require the financial support from our investors to further progress with the project. Up to this point, our ideas and plans have been all paper based. 
			</li>
			</ul>
<br />

		</ul>
	<li>5.5 Outstanding items/Future plans
		<ul>
		<li>The restrictions we currently face is of two things, the ability to access the service/hardware and financial support. We require the financial support from our investors to further progress with the project. Up to this point, our ideas and plans have been all paper based. 
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>5.5 Outstanding items/Future Plans
		<ul>
		<li>Future of the project are once we have delivered our sales pitch to potential investors and receive some funding; The plan for the future of the projects is as below: 
			<ol>
			<li>Hire the required staff with required skills OR outsource the work to a contractor.  
			<li>Build the backbone and infrastructure of the application/s 
			<li>Develop the UI and application 
			<li>Test the application 
			<li>Evaluate and change from the results 
			<li>Update and change application  
			<li>BETA test with live users 
			<li>Final evaluation 
			<li>Live Rollout 
			</li>
			</ol>
		<li>We will initialise by building the backbone of the application as per our plan. The backbone will be a steam line setup with linux based systems to host the application. Once we have set up the servers to host the application, we will need to get the application developed. Under the UAT testing phase, evaluation phase and re-development phase and rollout.  
		</li>
<br />
	</li>
	</ul>
<li><strong>6 Roles</strong>
	<p>Although our group has contributed in all aspects some people have stepped up in certain roles more than others so we have designated rolls for each individual. The roles we have chosen we believe are essential in founding a good tech startup these roles are Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Developer, Operations Manager, UI Designer and Chief Technical Officer(CTO). </p>
	
<br />
	<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>6.1 Chief Executive Officer</td>
    <td>Chief Executive Officer this is a role that everyone in our group could fit under as we were all part of the major decisions of our team. We have given this role to Don as he has been assigned chair of our team and has had the most responsibility in decision making due to him being the chair. Don also has experience in the IT sector so he is a good fit to chair and lead our team in the CEO position. The CEO’s main roles will be setting up our direction and strategy, implementing our goals and plans.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.2	Chief Marketing Officer</td>
    <td>James Parker has been assigned the role of CMO, we have elected James into this position due to his marketing background. Before working at team J James was working at a Fitness company and he specialized in marketing. The key roles of a CMO are User acquisition, focusing on brand identity, marketing and research and analytics.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6.3	Chief Technical Officer </td>
    <td>Jonathan Hazel has been assigned the role of chief technical officer this is a role that we have all contributed to as we have all worked on the early stages of developing the product and deciding which tools and programs we will develop the program on. We have chosen to assign Jonathon hazel to this role this is due to his experience in the IT field with over 25 years of experience as a linux/unix sys admin working at large companies like IBM, Texas instruments and AT&T he is well suited for the role of chief technical officer. The main roles of a CTO are developing product infrastructure, focusing on how the backend team can increase revenue and making sure we hit technical deadlines.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6.4	Operations Manager</td>
    <td>This is a role that has been shared equally throughout the group, we have all contributed as there hasn’t been one person who stood out to take this roll. The key roles of the operations manager to create the structure and processes of the team, reviewing logistics and HR and making sure that everything flows smoothly.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6.5	Developer</td>
    <td>James Eland and Jordan Uhe have been assigned the rolls of developer this is due to their focus on the website part of the project. The key roles for James and Jordan will be to Code and design the software, maintaining and implementing new ideas as well as coming up with ideas and improvements and maintaining the website.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>6.6	UI Designer</td>
    <td>This is another role that has been worked on by all members of the group however we have assigned Stefan as head of this role this is due to everyone having different creative styles and design philosophies so we believed that it was better if we all contributed but one person who is Stefan will make the final design choices as to not cause arguments and push us further away from achieving our goals. The key roles of the UI Designer are to present drafts and sketches to the other team members, create the flow of the program, create design ideas and create a user interface that aligns with the user requirements of the program.</td>
  </tr>

<br />
<li><strong> Scopes & Limits</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>The core function of this program is to check if a website has been updated and notify the user. Therefore, the first major Goal of the project to is implement a basic version of the desired final project which covers the core of checking if a website has been updated and then making a notification pop up on the computer.
	<li>To do this we will first design a non-functional mock-up of what is to be the final product and from that all features, but the core will be removed so that what is built to achieve the first major checkpoint is completely functional without any broken parts and could be a final product even if it does not include all promised functionality, but still has room to have more features implemented without a major redesign.
	<li>The second major feature would be more notification methods, such as text message and email.
	<li>The third major feature would be an improvement on how the app checks if a website has been updated, with instead of checking the whole website for a change a singular change or variable can be specified.
	<li>The fourth and final planned major feature would be the inclusion of a premium subscription option which can have the website checker run remotely on the cloud, so that the person does not have to have the computer on to be updated.
	<li>At this point our 4 versions timeline is only a guide to what and when something would be implemented, how the program gets improved will most likely be affected by how the users react to the program in the testing phase.
	<li>(Picture design > Website checker > More available methods to send notification. > More detailed website checks > Ability to run the website checker remotely on a server.)
	</li>
	</ul>
<br />
<li><strong>8 Tools</strong>
<p>As out lined in our earlier assignment Eavesdropper is a web-based chrome application that allows users to track websites for releases of their most desired items. The program will regularly check the HTML code of a specific website that the user has chosen. You can have Eavesdropper check for pre-set conditions of the code so that you only get notifications of items that interest you. Eavesdropper is designed for customers that are in the market for specific items and are only interested in availability and price changes of these items. Our program enables users to set parameters, so they are not flooded with irrelevant notifications.</p>
<br />
<p>Like a lot of small start-up businesses, we have a very tight budget so money for software, and hardware is limited. In addition, we want to develop our application on a small desktop or laptop initially but will be easy to scale as business expands. Everything we need for the development of our services and applications can be done using opensource software. Open-source software is software that is free to use and change as long as the changes and code are issued back to the original maintainer or maintainers (1 GNU Free Software Foundation) Free or opensource software is ideal for our purpose since it requires no initial financial output. We will be using what is called a LAMP stack, and open-source application and coding stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache webserver, MySQL database and PHP or Python for coding, and we will look at each part separately.</p>
<br />
<p>Most the world’s web servers run on Linux developed by Linus Torvalds (2 Linus Torvalds) as do the worlds data centres. There are countless Linux Distros or Distributions, each with there own offerings, but for our purpose we will use CentOS 8 (3) which is a fork of RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) (4 Red Hat). Red Hat is the one of the oldest and most successful Linux distributions but is now a commercial operation Like Microsoft. CentOS is a direct fork of RHEL and includes nearly all its features free of charge. We will be using CentOS 8 which is a very stable, scalable platform that can easily be migrated to the cloud. CentOS 8 is running the 4.18 kernel which is far from the newest Linux kernel, but CentOS, like RHEL, is all about stability for production systems. (5 Kernel Archives). The Kernel is the heart of system, so stability is key. Major changes include a changeup to the YUM (6 YUM) package manager, which is now based on the DNF. While it maintains the same command-line interface and stable API for sysadmin and DevOps integration these changes should make YUM faster so all system packages can be upgraded to the latest and most stable version. For developers, besides Git 2.18, CentOS offers these version control systems: Mercurial 4.8 and Subversion 1.10. Python (7Python.org) 3.6 is now CentOS’s default Python implementation, even though 3.8.10 is the latest release. There are several other default languages included in the build, Node.js 10.1, PHP 7.2, Ruby 2.5, Perl 5.26, and SWIG 3.0. The CentOS GCC compiler is based on version 8.2. It includes support for more recent C++ language standard versions, better optimizations, new code hardening techniques, improved warnings, and new hardware support. So, we have a very stable operating system with built in programming languages and compilers.</p>
<br />
<p>Since we are a web-based application, we need a webserver CentOS 8 comes with 2 web servers, Apache HTTP Server 2.4 is the latest stable release (8 Apache.org) and is licensed under Apache License 2.0. Apache is probably the longest running webserver and is an excellent feature packed webserver. The other option is and NGINX with the most stable release 1.18.0 and release under BSD licence 2. NGINX (9 NGINX) is a far newer web server around since 2004 and is a high performance easy to configure, more light weight and flexible web server that can also be used as a load balancer, mail proxy service and a HTTP caching service. Due to our limited budget on the physical hardware, load balancing and caching are good inbuilt options that reduce overhead. Of the two servers NGINX will be our choice.</p>
<br />
<p>As a we based application, that tracks the changes in price and quantity of rare items for fee paying customers we need a data base to keep track of information, such as customer names, payment history items of interest. By keeping relevant information on our customers our app can be more finely tuned and tailored to the interests of a variety of users. Individual users require different information, and it is important to keep track of this information. As our system improves and evolves, we will be able to offer more options for the customer to refine their parameters for a better experience. One of the features of our app is to send SMS messages or an email to notify the customer of any changes. To store this information, we need a database. CentOS 8 comes with several data bases but for our needs we will use MySQL version 8 (10) MySQL is an open-source relational database management system it can be tailored to deploy cloud-native applications it is very scalability, secure, reliable. In its simplest form it is easy to set up and configure and has a native web interface for administration and enable a web interface to display user information. There is one caveat to MySQL is that it now owned by Oracle (11), but it is free to a large extent. MySQL can be used freely within a web site MySQL license can be used free of charge for all projects that themselves run under the GPL or comparable free license. Since our application is built and uses open-source product, we can use it under the GPL licence (12 GPL).</p>
<br />
<p>In order to keep our clients informed of changes in their items of interest we need to send an email or SMS message. For this we will use another opensource application called iReadMail (13). iRedMail is a single package email server that scales from a single user to a company. It uses Postfix SMTP mail server version 3.5.10 released under IBM opensource license 2.0. (14). Postfix currently compromises 33%of the worlds Internet mail servers. iRedMail uses secure connections, POP3, IMAP over TLS (transport layer security) for mail services, and web mail access webmail with HTTPS. Emails are encrypted in transit using TLS, and passwords are encrypted and stored in SSHA512 or BCRYPT (Berkley Standard Distribution). The package includes a data base package of your choice, Anti-Spam, Anti-Virus protection, and a Web Admin Panel for easy Administration. The Postfix SMTP (simple message transfer protocol or MTA message transfer agent) can be configured to not only send email notifications to users but also SMS messages to their cell phone or number of their choice. As stated iRedMail is free but does provide a paid for professional support service. </p>
<br />
<p>The last item is what are we going to run our application on. By choosing the components we have in that they are not resource intensive, we can get away with running our project on a late model desktop or laptop for portability. We would need something like a 11th Generation I5 processor or AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS with a minimum of 16 GB of DDR4 RAM with expansion to 32GB of RAM. A minimum of a 500GB hard drive, preferably 1TB SSD would be preferable, cost being a factor. Graphics should be reasonable, but since this is not a graphics heavy application, we are more interested in memory, storage and processor. There are numerous laptops and desktops that fit our requirements for around $2000.</p>
<br />
<p>So, we have put together a very comprehensive software and operating system tool kit. It is reliable, flexible, well documented, has hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide and scalable. All the components we have selected are used by major companies the world over. It is not resource intensive, so our hardware output is minimal, and all components are free. This way we can develop an app that delivers what we intend it to do.</p>
<br />
<li><strong>9 Testing</strong>
<p>This Project will be split into inhouse testing and community testing.</p>
<br />
<p>The inhouse testing will further be split into developer testing and functionality testing. The developer testing will be as each feature or stage of the program is added, every part which interacts with it will be tested to ensure no bugs and errors appear and that the program is being built towards the intended direction. The functionality testing will be conducted by the non-programming/developer members of the group, they will test to see if the program actually works as intended and is intuitive for them to use, they will suggest any changes which appear to be needed in the to the interface such as changing the position of information and buttons and the removing and adding of them, as well as any visual and auditory changes needed to make the program more enjoyable to use so that the program can be improved.</p>
<br />
<p>If it is functional and intuitive for developers to use then the community testing will start, the testing is meant to see if people without any in-depth idea of how the program functions can operate the program without much hassle, for a program as small as what we are making, most people with experience with computers should be able to operate it without a step by step guide, because it is know that most people don’t read the manual anyway. It is called community testing because we will be using members from our friend and family groups because the program is meant to be useable for all genders and ages, so family members will cover the targeted demographics. The community testing group only needs to consist of 5-10 people, which we will monitor when they use the program to see what they intuitively want to do, and we will ask them at the end for feedback about what they find annoying with the program, what they like, suggestions, and would they use it, this is a small selection of the possible questions we will ask.</p>

	</ul>
<li><strong>12 Group Processes and Communication</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>The group will continue to do what they have done in Assignment 2. The form of communication is via video call using the application Teams. The meetings will be taking place with a minimum of two calls per week. As the individuals live in different areas in Australia, the only logical option is to meet using technology. 
	<li>The contingency plan for non-responding members of the group is to use a three-strike rule. First strike is not attending the scheduled meetings, a follow up email is sent to the user CC’ing the team advising of what the meeting was about and the agenda. Also checking up on the member to see if there are any issues and if the group can help in any way. If no response, another email is sent a week later. Three days after that if there is still no response, the group will meet with an emergency meeting to divide the work that member was in charge of. The leader will then notify the relevant people from the university.
