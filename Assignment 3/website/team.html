	<li>1.2 Scope
		<ul>
		<li>The scope of this document is to provide the reader an overview of where the project is completed to. This will help the reader understand what the group has completed so far, and what else needs to be done. By reading this document, the reader should be able to have a fair understanding of the applications capabilities and its potential developments goals.

	<li>1.3 Team Profile
		<ul>
		<li>Our Group or team J is made up of 6 members, we have a variety of backgrounds, educational levels and industry experience. We have variety of IT disciplines that interest us as well as different learning and personality types. The common thread that binds us together, is that we are all interested in technology in one form or another and we are all pursuing further academics and professional experience and qualifications. Working in a group is always challenging until you find your groove, and personality types need to be considered. Don Vu is an aural learner good at listening, he is neither to introverted or extraverted and tends to be agreeable. He is observant and not to judgmental, which makes him a good fit as team leader. James Eland is a little on the introverted side but is agreeable and conscience with are good team attributes. Jonathan Hazell is a hand on person and tends to be introverted but negotiable. James Parker tends to be extroverted and very agreeable, prefect for selling our product. Stefan Siotos is observant and a thinker, a little turbulent but keeps everyone on their toes. Jordan Uhe is agreeable and imaginative. So, in general our group was a good mix of personality types with no excesses in any direction, this led to smooth and effective dialogue. Educational wise we were at a variety of stages, some of us either starting a degree or had completed several years towards a Diploma. Don Vu has several IT certificates, Azure Web Services, CCNA, and MSCA. Work experience and IT experience was important in delegating various portions of the project to group members. Stefan Siotos has experience with software development at a vet important when developing a software app, James Parker is experienced in social media marketing, Jonathan Hazell has 20 years as Linux Systems Engineer, and Don Vu has multiple years’ experience as an IT Administrator. Each person’s experience was helpful in assigning them a role to in our project. As for future employment, everyone was interested in pursuing a technology related job, which was to be expected. All jobs related to Cloud infrastructure in some form or another if not directly. Don Vu is interested in IT Service manager position, a position that demands a wide range of skills. James Eland is interested in a position as an IT Analyst, James Parker is interested in being a Project Manager and implementing vendor applications. Jonathan Hazell is looking at a job as a Linux Engineer, which fits in with mot of his work history. Stefan Siotos is interested in Machine learning and Jordan Uhe’s desired job is Cloud Operations Manager. Looking at the psychological profiles that each member did, you can see a correlation between the results and their job interests. Working together as a group is not easy mainly due to personality differences and experience. Group J was comprised of individuals that where mostly middle ground, did not fall to either extreme and where mostly agreeable, conscience and had a desire to see our project comes to completion. We each had experience in some form of technology so parts could be given to each member. As the project progressed group members became much more active and participated more. In the end we formed a very cohesive group that participated well.

	<li>1.4 Group Process
		<ul>
		<li>The group worked relatively well in Assignment 2, our meeting schedule was designed in a way that would allow each member to actively participate in the course lecture and tutorials and also have time to attend the meeting. As a result, we kept the same meeting schedule.
		<li>The group meets twice a week (mainly Mondays and Saturdays) our main form of communication is Team’s video call which occurs twice a week. During the week if we need any additional support or questions answered, we can contact each other via email or Team’s messaging. 
		<li>The process for workload in the group is kept the same. The group goes through the assignment together on the first meeting, clarifying issues and uncertainties. The group then decides which parts they would like to do or which parts suits a member best, the part or parts is then allocated to that member and is expected to have it done by the agreed date.
		<li>During the teaching period, members can ask each other for help and if others are willing, they can assist. If not, the group will come together and work through that part together to accomplish that section.

	<li>1.6 Career Plans
		<ul>
		<li>All members of our team had different career plans but there were some similarities between our plans, the main similarity is that all jobs are centred around the IT field. Some peoples plan aligns closer than others and some people don’t have similarities with anyone. James Parker and Don Vu both plan on being in a managerial role however James is planning on working as a Project manager and Don is wanting to work as an operations manager. Jordan is planning on working as a cloud operations manager which aligns with Jonathon who is a Linux System administrator both roles require experience and skills in cloud operations and server management. Jordan and Jonathon differ from James and Don by one main point which is where Don and James want to manage teams and operations James and Don would rather do a more hands on role. Stefan is planning on going into the Machine Learning field which is currently more of a research and learning role compared to the others and James Eland is planning on working as an IT analyst which is more closely aligned with Jordan and Jonathon.

<ul>
 <li><strong>2 Project Description</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>2.1 The passions, interests and skills of your group
		<ul>
		<li>Our group comes from a very diverse skillset and mindset in relation to IT. Some already has industry certification and already have a job in the IT industry; whereas some are in an unrelated field and wish to gain entry into the industry.
		<li>Regardless of where one stands in the industry it is always the advanced technology, the breakthrough and revolutionary technology that intrigues the team and makes them want to learn more about it. 
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>2.2 IT industry trends
		<ul>
		<li>The trend in the IT industry now is about convenience and AI; the smarter the technology is, the less smart the user needs to be to use the technology to complete their desired task. As a result, the technology needs to become more sophisticated and complex to make up for the shortfall.
		<li>The idea of advancing technology is so that it can do more, cost less and take up less space and time. To do more, the technology needs to be smarter or at least capable of learning so it can eventually do more for the common man to do less. Cost less is a major concern for the common man as if there is an advanced technology but no one can afford it except for the extremely rich; then its not really being used by the general public. Lastly taking up less space and time, advancing means to be portable as well. For example, now a full sized i7 laptop can be in a size of a hand-held gaming console. 
		</li>
		</ul>
<br />
	<li>2.3 What would assist you in your carrer plan
		<ul>
		<li>Working through this project will allow members of the team to take part in a project plan, do project work and gain project experience. This will particularly help the members with management roles as their career goal as it will develop their management skills in regards to time, funds and project milestones.
