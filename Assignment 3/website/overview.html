<li><strong>3 Overview</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>3.1 Topic
		<ul>
		<li>The project Eavesdropper was intended to help people get information of certain websites and be able to be one of the first people in the world to know about the changes to the website. The website could be anything the user would like it to be and be useful to everyone in their personal way. By having this chrome extension, this would significantly help people to get the information they would like to get and get notified when something in the website has been changed. The outcome is to have people get what information from their chosen websites as soon as the website has been changed. This will have people get informed about changes a lot quicker rather than people scramming and refreshing pages all the time. This will allow people to discuss about certain things sooner and be able to create hype for the product or event that is going to happen. This chrome extension will also grow from people using it and talking about it.
		</li>
		</ul>
	<li>3.2 Motivation
		<ul>
		<li>The motivation of Eavesdropper is because of the fact that people would be interested in limited edition items, a new TV series or whatever the consumer is interested in. People who might have forgotten when a certain item would come out, those people will get reminded and be able to purchase what they would like or even watch the latest episode without getting spoiled of anything. Eavesdropper will be able to inform a future employer about how useful the information that the chrome extension is and how it is able to inform the user about the website getting an update to the website.
		</li>
		</ul>
	<li>3.3 Landscape
		<ul>
		<li>There are many other web alert extensions that are out there and really useful in their own way. All of these web alerts do the same thing as our chrome extension but have their own features to it. For example, visualping, buzzbundle and talkwalker alert.  The difference with our chrome extension is that it is not just limited to certain areas of the internet. Our extension covers the majority of different areas of the internet. It does not just notify you on your desktop when you are using the internet but the extension is also able to inform the user through email and text. The extension would send you a link to the website and inform you what has changed. It can even highlight the area where the change has occurred.
